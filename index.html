	<h1> CityPost: DH 150 Assignment 9 </h1>
	<h3> By Annie Lieu</h3>
	<h4> In a world that demands digital nomadacy and remote lifestyles, the way we access information and communicate with each other online becomes essential. As various social media platforms battle to become onlines networks on a global stage, we sought to bring social media back home; back to your community and your neighborhood. </h4>

	<h3> Design Statement </h3>
	<p> <em> How might I design an accessible digital experience that shares information, events, and builds community for middle aged women? </em> </p>
	<p> Currently, reigning social media apps (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube) battle to become the top host site to connect people on a global stage (boasting millions of DAUs) . While this is important, I realized that, especially with quarantine, we were losing sight of organic relationships we fostered before social media; with our neighbors. Too often it is easier to simply connect with strangers online than to know your neighbor's name. I sought to build a niche social media platform that was catered to rebuild that trust and authentic friendships with those we live with. </p>

	<p> Middle aged women, in particular, lie at a point of society where meeting strangers online is an extra security concern. I designed with them as a target audience in mind becuase I wanted a platform that was safe (vetted neighbors) as well as very easy to use and onboard due to middle aged women's busy lifestyles. </p>

	<h3> Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation </h3>

	<p>I started this design process by analyzing top comptetitors in the "neighborhood" social media space: <b>NextDoor</b> and <b>Meetup</b>. This included a heuristic evaluation with participants and detailed process and findings can be found here. 

	In general, participants found that Nextdoor was too cluttered with information, making it <em>frustrating to navigate </em> for certain tasks and information. Specifically, there was a lack of filters, organizational structure, and overstimulation of categories. On the other hand, participants found Meetup <em>underwhelmingingly too simple and generalized </em> to host a broader span of interests/important information to build a community. Specifically, instead of building a general sense of community, Meetup served more as a temporary function to host niche groups' meetups. </p>
